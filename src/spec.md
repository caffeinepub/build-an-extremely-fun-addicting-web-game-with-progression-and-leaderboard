# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Upgrade the 2D game’s visuals to feel AAA-quality while preserving the existing Pepe/toad-killer crypto meme aesthetic and keeping all gameplay/UI flows unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Upgrade/replace existing static art assets (logo, menu/results background, in-game background, token and hazard icons) with higher-fidelity versions that render crisply on high-DPI/retina displays.
- Improve 2D canvas rendering fidelity to use the upgraded sprites/assets (instead of simple fallback circles/glows), with more premium lighting/composition and higher-quality particles/VFX while respecting the Reduced Motion setting.
- Polish UI presentation across Landing, HUD, Results, Leaderboard, Settings, and Shop using upgraded backgrounds/overlays and more cohesive iconography, without changing navigation/behavior or English text.

**User-visible outcome:** The game looks significantly more premium and detailed (backgrounds, sprites, UI, and effects) while playing the same as before and remaining smooth and stable across common desktop and mobile resolutions.
