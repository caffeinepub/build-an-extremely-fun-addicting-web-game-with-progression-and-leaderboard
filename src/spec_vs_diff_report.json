  "summary": "Diff adds a generated asset registry and canvas asset loader, upgrades canvas rendering (retina scaling, parallax/vignette, enhanced particles, sprite-based token/hazard rendering), and applies more “premium” UI styling plus usage of generated logo/background on Landing and Results. However, the diff does not show the required raster assets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and the renderer does not load/render a player sprite from generated assets. Diff also introduces additional generated assets and copy changes not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "New high-fidelity raster assets exist under frontend/public/assets/generated using the filenames specified in this build request (logo, menu background, ingame background, token icon, toad hazard icon).",
      "reason": "The diff only shows TypeScript/CSS/HTML changes referencing these files, but no evidence of the actual raster files being added/replaced under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Canvas scene should use detailed sprite rendering for the player (not just tokens/hazards) when new assets are available, avoiding simple fallback circles/glows.",
      "reason": "The renderer asset loader only loads background, token, hazard, and a UI sheet—no player sprite asset is defined/loaded, so player-specific sprite rendering from generated assets is not implemented in the shown changes.",
