  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-4 appear implemented (title rename in index.html + landing UI; visual viewport/dynamic height + canvas sizing using visualViewport). Multiplier work (REQ-2/REQ-3) appears partially implemented: game state now includes a multiplier and HUD can display it, but HUD only renders the multiplier when > 1, which may fail the AC requiring the current multiplier value to be shown during gameplay (including at base value). Blue-ball(shield) reset behavior is only evidenced via a file-summary statement due to truncation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "The HUD shows the current multiplier value (not only the streak label) and it updates live as gameplay events change the multiplier.",
      "reason": "The HUD multiplier indicator is conditionally rendered only when multiplier > 1, so during normal/base gameplay (multiplier === 1) the current multiplier value is not shown, which may not meet the acceptance criterion of showing the current multiplier value.",
